# Advance E-commerce Website in Laravel

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is an **Advanced E-commerce Website** built with Laravel, inspired by the popular YouTube “Stack Developer” advanced Laravel eCommerce development series.  
Due to my location and limitations, I was unable to follow the mentor fully, so I completed the project based on my own plan and learning pace. The series is quite extensive, and I adapted and customized it for my context.

**My goal was to enhance my real-world skills, tackle complex problems, and complete a full-featured e-commerce application.**
